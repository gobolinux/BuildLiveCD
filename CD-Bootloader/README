This CD is compressed as a set of SquashFS images. To access its contents:

  * You may add SquashFS support to your existing system (GoboLinux kernel has
    this support by default) and then mount the desired image:
    $ mount -o loop -t squashfs /Mount/CD-ROM/Packages-List-Base.squashfs /Mount/SquashFS

  * Alternatively, you may boot from the CD.  This uses the ISOLINUX
    bootloader.

  * In addition, you may boot from USB flash devices by copying the ISO file to
    the flash device using a tool such as 'dd':
    $ dd if=GoboLinux-016.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/<flash_device>
